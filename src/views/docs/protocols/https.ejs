<h1>https</h1>

<p>The https is identical to the http protocol, except for the fact that it uses
a self-signed certificate.  You may have to configure your code to disable
certificate validation (e.g. use the <code>-k</code> switch in <code>curl</code>.</p>

<p>See the <a href='/docs/protocols/http'>http</a> page for examples.  Just be sure
to change the <code>protocol</code> parameter to <code>https</code> during imposter
creation!</p>
