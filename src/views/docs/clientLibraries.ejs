<h1>Client Libraries</h1>

<p>While mountebank speaks <a href='/docs/api/overview'>REST</a>, he truly loves your native language
and has no desire to make you learn another language.  If you have a native library you'd like others
to be able to use, please send mountebank a note on the <a href='/support'>support page</a> or through
a pull request to this page and he will add it to the list below.</p>

<p>Some of these are still in their early stages.  Feel free to help the authors out ;></p>
