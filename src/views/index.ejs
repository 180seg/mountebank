      <h1>Welcome, friend</h1>

      <p>mountebank is the first tool to provide multi-protocol, multi-language test
      doubles over the wire.  Just point your application under test to mountebank
      instead of the real dependency, and test like you would with traditional stubs and mocks.</p>

      <p>mountebank will tell you that he supports every protocol ever invented, and
      a few lying in the weeds. He will swear that he supports bindings in every language
      known to humanity. Some of the implementations are lagging, but worry not, for his
      team of open source developers is legion.</p>

        <p>If mountebank would have been available back in my day, we wouldn't have
           spent the last 2,700 years complaining about how long it takes to build Rome.</p>
