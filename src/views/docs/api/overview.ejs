<h1>API Overview</h1>

<p>mountebank, being a man of the people, prefers the simple words of the vernacular over
the silvery speech of the priesthood.  As if to prove the point, he speaks in a RESTful
<code>application/json</code> rather than <code>application\vnd.mountebank+json</code>.
While he does provide hypermedia, it is more as a convenience to you, with no professorial
dictate that you follow the script provided.  To show how committed he is to that principle,
all resources are described below, complete with URL templates.</p>

<p>mountebank uses a basic set of HTTP status codes.  He knows that a 200 or 201 will
make you happiest, but unfortunately he cannot guarantee that you will always receive
one of those codes.  In the cases where the input you provide is malformed in some
fashion, he will offer a humble apology for not being clear about what he needs, and
respond with a 400.  In situations where you ask for a port that mountebank
is unable to reserve, he will return you a 403.  Every effort has gone into providing
<a href='/docs/api/errors'>response bodies</a> to help you diagnose the problems.  Each
error response returned will have a <code>code</code> and <code>message</code> at a minimum.
If extra information is available, mountebank will happily pass it to you.  If you get stuck,
email the group on the <a href='/support'>support page</a>, along with your logs, and mountebank
will happily assist you.</p>

<p>mountebank has made every effort to spare you from 5xx HTTP codes.  If you are
unfortunate enough to receive one, first you should know that mountebank is most embarrassed.
Please <a href='/support'>report</a> the issue with the log details, and mountebank will
help make it right for you.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h3>Home</h3>

<ul>
  <li>URL template: <code>/</code></li>
  <li>HTTP verbs: <code>GET</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Unpretentious and welcoming, mirroring mountebank's simple good nature.  This endpoint
exists for those who aspire to the RESTful
<a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html'>priesthood</a>,
though they may be disappointed to find such a lowly language as <code>application/json</code>
and the lack of URLs for relationships.  mountebank has no intention of forcing anybody to use
this endpoint, and does not intend to use it for his implemenation of native language bindings.</p>

    }
  }

<h3>Imposters</h3>

<ul>
  <li>URL template: <code>/imposters</code></li>
  <li>HTTP verbs: <code>GET, POST</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Though he's not proud to admit it, mountebank employs an army of imposters to
fulfill your orders.  Because your needs are varied and sundry, his imposters
are all different, and all are identified by a port number and associated with
a protocol.  mountebank expects that you will be responsible for providing the
port, since you'll need to configure the application under test with the same
port.  However, the port is not required, and if you do not include it in the
request, mountebank will randomly assign one for you and return the port number
in the response.</p>

<p>The value you get out of mountebank always starts by creating an imposter.  If
you don't need stubbing, then the port and protocol are all you need.</p>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-step='1'
           data-test-type='http'>
POST /imposters HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:<%= port %>
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "port": 4545,
  "protocol": "http"
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-verify-step='1'
           data-test-ignore-lines='["^Date"]'>
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost:<%= port %>/imposters/4545
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 165
Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2014 16:28:40 GMT
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "protocol": "http",
  "port": 4545,
  "requests": [],
  "stubs": [],
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:<%= port %>/imposters/4545"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would also create any <a href='/docs/api/stubs'>stubs</a> in the <code>POST</code> call.
Imposters are immutable once created.  The expected use case is that they are setup for a single
test run and destroyed at the completion of the test.</p>

<p>mountebank expects you to configure your application under test to point to the imposter.  In
the case above, that would mean that your application has an http dependency configured to
http://localhost:3535.  To retrieve a list of all imposters, simply issue a <code>GET</code>:</p>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-step='2'
           data-test-type='http'>
GET /imposters HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:<%= port %>
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-verify-step='2'
           data-test-ignore-lines='["^Date"]'>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "imposters": [
    {
      "protocol": "http",
      "port": 4545,
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://localhost:<%= port %>/imposters/4545"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Imposter</h3>

<ul>
  <li>URL template: <code>/imposters/{port}</code></li>
  <li>HTTP verbs: <code>GET, DELETE</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This resource is likely where you will do mock verifications that certain calls were
made.  Both a <code>GET</code> and <code>DELETE</code> return the same body, but a
<code>DELETE</code> frees up the port and removes the resource.  If you are concerned
about optimizing the number of REST calls made during a test run, avoid the <code>GET</code>
and get all the requests during the <code>DELETE</code> call:</p>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-step='3'
           data-test-type='http'>
DELETE /imposters/4545 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:<%= port %>
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-test-id='imposters'
           data-test-verify-step='3'
           data-test-ignore-lines='["^Date"]'>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 165
Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2014 16:59:33 GMT
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "protocol": "http",
  "port": 4545,
  "requests": [],
  "stubs": [],
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:<%= port %>/imposters/4545"
    }
  }
}
